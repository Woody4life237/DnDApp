# DnDApp
Application for Dungeons and Dragons

ToDo:

Have current slots auto update to total, when total is entered
Add HP Tracker    
Ability to add additional custom trackers    
Ability to hide all spell slots with '0' but also be able to readd them     
Save multiple characters       
Ability to communicate with other devices on same app so to have full party stats avaliable to whole party      
 - Maybe something for the DM too         
 - All stats, HP, AC, Dex etc.

Spellbook? with desc is copyright issue but can have players add them independantly        
Adding 'character creation' where you pull level and class to get spell slots auto      

 - Only avaliable with 'free to play' classes? more CR issues??        

fixed rotation OR fix the landscape version
